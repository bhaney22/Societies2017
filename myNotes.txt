Done -- 1. Delete Diffusion Delay
2. Group 0: standard
   Group 1: inventPower = 0.01
   See how they do.
3. Decrease fast-gathering group's inventing speed, instead of increasing slow-gathering group's inventing speed.
   Group 0: standard/norm
   Group 1:
	gathering spped -- 1.5/4.5
	inventPower -- 0.1
Done -- 4. Set INVENTOR_DEVICE_EXPERIENCE = MAX_DEVICE_DEPERIENCE, i.e. 40
   Test and see the results
Done -- 5. Rename
   inventPower to inventSpeed
   CrossGroup_TOtal to CrossGroup
Done -- 6. Add both resTP and devTP together
